    "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval technique with language model generation to improve the accuracy and credibility of the generated text, and to better ground the model’s response in evidence. In RAG, a language model is augmented with an external knowledge base or a set of documents that is passed into the context window. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of RAG lies the seamless integration of two key components:\n",
    "1. **Vector Databases/ Retriever:** These specialized databases store and index information in a vector representation (so called vector embedding), enabling similarity searches and retrieval of relevant data.\n",
    "2. **Large Language Models (LLMs)/ Generator:** Takes the retrieved information and the original query as input, and produced human-like output that incorporates both factual knowledge and contextual understanding. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the retrieved information with the LLM`s language generation capabilities, the RAG system can produce more accurate, relevant and credible responses compared to using the LLM alone. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the concept better, let`s compare in the following the basic system with a RAG system. Let’s start with a basic system. A basic system is composed of a prompt, a model, and an output parser. The basic system illustrates the core idea of using LLMs in a structured way by defining the input (prompt), the processing step (model), and the output handling (output parser). It serves as a foundational concept that can be extended and combined with other components to build more complex chains and applications. Below, an illustration of the basic chain architecture is provided. <br> <br>\n",
    " ![basic_chain.png](Basic_chain.png) <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A RAG system on the other hand adds context when responding to questions. Let’s break down RAG system by a RAG prompt, a RAG retriever, and a RAG chain as illustrated in the following. <br> <br>\n",
    " ![basic_chain.png](RAG_chain.png) <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here`s a step-by-step breakdown how a RAG system is structured and how it works: <br>\n",
    "***Data preparation:***\n",
    "1. The raw data sources (e.g. PDF files) are loaded.\n",
    "2. The information of the loaded data sources are extracted (e.g. text from the PDF files).\n",
    "3. The huge amount of text is spilled/ chunked to smaller pieces.\n",
    "4. The chunks are then indexed into a numerical vector  (Embedding) and stored as a vector database (vector store). <br> <br>\n",
    "***RAG:*** <br>\n",
    "1. A user provides a query or prompt to the RAG system.\n",
    "2. The query is then converted to vector embeddings, so the information can be processed for the next step.\n",
    "3. The retriever component searches through the created vector database to find the most relevant information related to the query (vector similarity search).\n",
    "3. The retrieved relevant data/ information along with the original query, is passed to the generator component (the LLM).\n",
    "4. The LLM generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information, providing a more accurate and context-aware answer to the user`s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the strength of LLMs and information retrieval techniques, RAG systems offer a promising approach to overcome some of the limitations of LLMs and enhancing the quality and reliability of generated text. The benefits of using RAG in enhancing LLM credibility and accuracy are numerous:\n",
    "1. **Improved factual accuracy:** By incorporating relevant information from reliable sources, RAG systems can help reduce the instances of factual errors of inconsistencies in the generated text.\n",
    "2. **Enhanced credibility:** RAG systems can provide citations or references to the sources of information used in the generated response, increasing the credibility and trustworthiness of the output.\n",
    "3. **Access to up-to-date information:** RAG systems can be designed to retrieve information from continuously updated sources, ensuring that the generated responses are based on the most recent and relevant information available.\n",
    "4. **Customization and domain-specific knowledge:** RAG systems can be tailored to specific domains or use cases by incorporating domain-specific knowledge bases or documents, enabling the generation of more accurate and relevant responses within a particular field or context. <br>\n",

A higher temperature value (e.g., 1.5) makes the model's responses more random and creative, while a lower temperature value (e.g., 0.9) makes the responses more deterministic and focused. The default value is typically around 1.1. The chosen value of 0 means the model will produce the most deterministic and predictable output, essentially always choosing the highest probability token at each step. This makes the responses very repetitive and lacks the creativity or variability you'd see with higher temperatures. It's like playing it safe and not taking any chances.\n",
